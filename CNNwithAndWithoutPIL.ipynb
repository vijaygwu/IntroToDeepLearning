        "### **Key Points:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Performance**:\n",
        "   - The **without PIL** approach is faster and more efficient because it skips the unnecessary step of converting between image formats. By directly handling the images as tensors, this method allows for faster data loading, training, and testing, particularly important in large-scale datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Flexibility**:\n",
        "   - The **using PIL** approach offers more flexibility for custom image manipulation. For instance, if you need to perform advanced image preprocessing, like applying filters, specific augmentations, or detailed custom transformations, the PIL approach gives you more control.\n",
        "   - However, **without PIL** is still capable of common transformations like resizing, normalization, and flipping, but it's more constrained to the functionalities provided by `torchvision.transforms`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Complexity**:\n",
        "   - **Using PIL** adds complexity because it requires creating a custom dataset class and manually handling image conversions. This additional code increases the risk of bugs and makes the code more difficult to maintain.\n",
        "   - **Without PIL** is simpler and easier to manage since you're using PyTorch’s built-in functions for handling datasets and transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Use Cases**:\n",
        "   - **Using PIL** is more appropriate when working with custom datasets where you might need non-standard image preprocessing steps.\n",
        "   - **Without PIL** is ideal for standard tasks like MNIST classification, where the dataset is already structured and doesn't require complex image manipulations. This approach is faster and easier to implement.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Which Approach Should You Use?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Use `PIL`** when:\n",
        "  - You need **advanced image preprocessing**.\n",
        "  - You're working with **custom datasets** that require custom image handling.\n",
        "  - You want **fine-grained control** over how images are loaded and processed.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Skip `PIL` (Use tensors directly)** when:\n",
        "  - You're working with **standard datasets** like MNIST, CIFAR, etc.\n",
        "  - You prioritize **efficiency** and **simplicity**.\n",
        "  - You want to reduce **code complexity** and **training time**.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, for most typical scenarios like MNIST classification, **not using PIL** is the better choice due to its efficiency, simplicity, and ease of use. However, **using PIL** offers more control when you need custom processing for complex datasets."
